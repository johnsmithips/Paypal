Point system instead of money transaction for trading which leads to profit for everyone and FASTER transaction.

usually in ebanking if someone buys any product, the mediator(eg.paypal) should connect the bank and proceed the transaction. Instead of connecting with the bank, the transaction can be made simpler between the mediator and user alone.

Pointing system:

1.Initially user should buy the points from the mediator.Here in my project i have used GOLD, SILVER, BRONZE for refering points of different worth.
     eg. GOLD = $ 10,000
         SILVER = $ 5,000
         BRONZE = $ 1,000
         
2.After he bought the points he would have some values in his paypal account. eg. gold = 5 points, silver =15 points and so on

3. using which user can buy any product.

    eg. If the user is about to buy the product of worth = $ 17,000
      the following dedcution will be happened from user point balance
      
      ------------------deduction = Point_balance - (1 * GOLD) - (1 * SILVER) - (2 * BRONZE)---------------- 
      
      the above deduction value will be reduced from his account.


Drawbacks in current system:

1.slower since lots of procedure in online banking.

2.if any server gets troubled whole process get collapsed. (Especially bank servers)

3.government taxes and other stuffs
      
Advantages:

1.No need to connect with bank anymore. just from user point balance system the transaction can be done.

2.since the transaction occurs between user and mediator, the process is faster. but not when connected with bank.

3.No taxes for selling or buying the products. It's enough to mention the worht of the product.

4.for governmental tax and other purposes the tax can be paid when the user buys points.



NOTE: In this process there is no occurance of banking server anywhere except during buying the points.
